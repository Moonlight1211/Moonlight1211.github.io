# Moonlight1211.github.io

This is the development of my official personal website.

You can find it at:
https://moonlight1211.com

I used google domains to purchase the domain, and I am using GitHub pages to host my own HTML content, since google domains doesn't natively allow you to upload your own HTML content.

I have no other contributors for this project, nor a plan in regards to the website content. Everything you see on it is subject to change in the future if I don't like it.
