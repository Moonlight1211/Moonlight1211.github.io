            a significant part of my online presence (especially on instagram) is in relation to philosophy, or politics to some extent. For the past 2~
            years i've been discovering new thinkers, new concepts, and new perspectives that evolve and refine my overall philosophical tendency over time.<br>
        <br>
            However, its reached a point where now my philosophy is too abstract sometimes, even for myself, to understand. I feel less capable of answering
            previously obvious questions, and less confident in my political/philosophical view overall. I've also failed to be entirely publicly clear what my positions
            are, and I'd like to help introduce newer people to the higher-end of modern philosophy. I feel like it would be beneficial, not only for anybody wishing
            to understand my philosophy, or know my true opinion on a certain topic, but also to the continual progression of my philosophy, as i form a grounded base for it's development. <br>
        <br>
            In this page I've done my best to summarize many of the most complex, foundational, or abstract positions I have, and explain them as concisely as possible. I will include as much
            context as I feel is necessary for a certain position (for example, in the discussion of capitalism, i wont be providing the entire historical context of the feudalist-style economy,
            mercantile capitalism, the industrial revolution, etc. if the point i'm making doesn't directly involve those things.) If you want a further explanation or have any questions, feel 
            free to talk to me directly on instagam or discord, which are linked on this site.

        <h4>politics</h4>
        <p>
            My position on politics is complex and I don't think I'm at a point where I can say I confidently feel one way or another. On one hand, it is evidently a tool of
            the bourgeoisie to further their class interest. That is immutably the case, as the entire congressional body of "representatives" consists of rich business people,
            lobbyists of large corporate industries, bourgeois actors, or opportunists professing to progressivism or socialism, whilst only serving capitalist interests in
            their practices. <br> 
            At the same time, there really is not much the proletariat presently has a grasp on to further its interests. To dismiss the electoral process entirely is
            reasonable, but I struggle to see what exactly can be done beyond it. Almost all leftist "organization" we see in the western world has been either outright
            opportunist, co-opted by bourgeois actors, or forcefully shut down by the bourgeois state. <br> 
            I find the trap most leftists fall into when discussing present events is they persistently relate them into future "communist" or "socialist" conditions.
            Every critique those leftists make of any present capitalist event or condition is always linked to their utopian future socialism, and it always seems so foolish
            to me. How can we possibly have any conception of conditions expanding so far into the future? Linking capitalist conditions to communist ones is misunderstanding
            the nature of communism and how it realizes in society. We can never truly know if the steps we take now are closer to communism, to fascism, or 
            will just reproduce capital once again. there's simply too many variables for us to accurately plan ahead. <br>
            <br>
            I believe that there is no optimal path forward from this point.<br>
            <br>

        <h4>capitalism</h4>
        <p>
            If it somehow wasn't already apparent enough, I am opposed to the structure of capitalism.
