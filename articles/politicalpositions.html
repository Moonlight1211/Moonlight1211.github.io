                It should be noted that I am 17 years old as of writing this, so my political and philosophical journey is far from over, but so far I am happy with the 
                intellectual progress that i've made through my few years of gaining political literacy, and I feel like its an important enough part of my personality
                for me to discuss it in one of the pages on this site.
                <br>
                <br>
                I will start by clarifying that I am a marxist, black liberationist, queer liberationist, gender accelerationist, and overall extreme progressive. 
                However, I don't prescribe myself to any specific ideological tendency, and I think people who do are often uneducated on the deeper political,
                philosophical, and historical intricacies that contribute to the specifics of an ideology or tendency. I naturally found myself more attracted
                to certain concepts, thinkers, philosophies, positions, etc. that lead me to the positions that I hold now, and althought I am not familiar with
                all of the theory and history and philosophy of everything that led me to the views I have now, I will say that I feel very comfortable describing
                and defending them, moreso than I did in the past when I had prescribed myself to ideological tendencies.
                A humorous, but rough, summarized description of my beliefs could be expressed as follows: <br>
                <p class="tab" id="politicalPositionsIdeologyText">"Deleuzo-Leninist Marxism with Damenite and Maoist characteristics"</p>
